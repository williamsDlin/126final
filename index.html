  <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    For my final project in <strong>COMP 126</strong>, I developed a website prototype inspired by a real-world opportunity I received this semester.
    I was honored to be recruited by <a href="https://rls.sites.oasis.unc.edu/" target="_blank">Professor Richard L. Smith</a>, Chair of the Organizing Committee for the
    <a href="https://eva2025.unc.edu/" target="_blank">EVA 2025 Conference</a>, to assist in managing the event's official website.
    Although the final EVA 2025 site was ultimately built using WordPress to facilitate collaborative development,
    I seized this opportunity to apply the skills acquired in this course to create an independent website draft from scratch.
  </p>
  <p>
    This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>responsive design</strong>,
    effectively bridging classroom learning with a professional setting.
    I would like to express my sincere gratitude to
    <a href="https://cs.unc.edu/person/tessa-joseph-nicholas/" target="_blank">Professor Tessa Joseph-Nicholas</a> for her exceptional guidance throughout the semester.
    Her support and instruction were instrumental in equipping me with the confidence and skills necessary to undertake this challenge.
